Feature: Authorization command
  In order to use Terminus
  As a user
  I need to be able to log in to the system.

    And I should get: "Server error: `POST https://onebox/api/authorize/machine-token` resulted in a `500 Internal Server Error` response:"
    And I should get: "Authorization failed. Please check that your machine token is valid."

    Could not find a saved token identified by invalid.
    """

  Scenario: Failing to log in automatically when multiple machine tokens have been saved

    """
